If you are using Maven and you need to load test your projects, you can use the JMeter Maven plugin. 
This plugin enables you to run tests from within the Maven project, instead of running performance tests as scripts in JMeter.

Now letâ€™s take the JMeter script and see how you can run it from Maven as part of the build. 
The JMeter Maven plugin allows you to do just that.
<build>
     <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.lazerycode.jmeter</groupId>
            <artifactId>jmeter-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.1.0</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>jmeter-tests</id>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>jmeter</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

Create a src/test/jmeter directory, and place your JMeter load test there.
 When running the project, the JMeter Maven plugin searches for tests to run in this directory.
 
--> mvn verify

The raw results are located at /target/jmeter/results.The report generated will be something like .....jtl.
