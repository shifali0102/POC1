we’ll go over a number of different ways to use Maven for integration testing and to separate integration tests from unit tests.

An important thing to notice about integration testing is that test methods often take quite a long time to run.

As a result, we should exclude integration tests from the default build lifecycle, keeping them from slowing down the whole process 
each time we build a project.
A convenient way to separate integration tests is to use build profiles. This kind of configuration enables us to execute integration
tests only when necessary – by specifying a suitable profile
The simplest way to run integration tests is to use the Maven failsafe plugin.
By default, the Maven surefire plugin executes unit tests during the test phase, while the failsafe plugin runs integration tests
in the integration-test phase.
The default naming conventions enforced by surefire and failsafe are different, thus we just need to follow these conventions to 
segregate unit and integration tests.

The execution of the 
surefire plugin includes all classes whose name starts with Test, or ends with Test, Tests or TestCase.
In contrast,
the failsafe plugin executes test methods in classes whose name starts with IT, or ends with IT or ITCase.
